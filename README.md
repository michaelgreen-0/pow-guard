# Layer 7 DDoS Guard

This service sits between the client and server as a means of preventing DDoS attacks that act on the application layer.

## Description

As the service deems there to be excessive traffic, clients will be required to solve a proof-of-work problem.
On an individual level, this will not be noticeable to a normal user.
However, in cases of a botnet, the computational power required to maintain an attack dimishes quickly as the proof-of-work difficulty increases.
